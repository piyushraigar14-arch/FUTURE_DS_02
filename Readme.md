#### Telco Customer Churn Analysis



##### Overview

This project explores the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**. The goal is to understand why customers leave (churn) and what factors help them stay. As a beginner in data science, I used tools like **Excel, and Tableau** to clean the data, analyze patterns, and build dashboards that make the results easy to see.

##### **Dataset**

\- Source: Telco Customer Churn dataset (Excel file provided).

\- Key columns:

&nbsp; - **CustomerID** – unique identifier

&nbsp; - **Tenure** – how many months a customer has stayed

&nbsp; - **Contract Type** – month‑to‑month, one year, two year

&nbsp; - **Payment Method** – electronic check, credit card, bank transfer, mailed check

&nbsp; - **Internet Service** – DSL, Fiber optic, or none

&nbsp; - **Monthly Charges** – how much the customer pays

&nbsp; - **Churn** – Yes (customer left) or No (customer stayed)

##### **What I Did**

###### 1\. **Data Cleaning**  

&nbsp;  - Checked for missing values and corrected formats (like tenure as numbers).  

&nbsp;  - Grouped tenure into cohorts (0–12, 13–24, etc.).



###### 2\. **Exploratory Analysis**  

&nbsp;  - Looked at churn rates by tenure, contract type, payment method, internet service, and monthly charges.  

&nbsp;  - Found that churn is highest in the first year and among month‑to‑month contracts.



###### 3\. **Visualizations**  

&nbsp;  - Built charts in **Excel** and **Tableau**:

&nbsp;    - Cohorts by Tenure

&nbsp;    - Churn by Contract Type

&nbsp;    - Churn by Payment Method

&nbsp;    - Churn by Internet Service

&nbsp;    - Churn by Monthly Charges

&nbsp;    - Overall churn rate (KPI)



###### 4\. **Dashboard**  

&nbsp;  - Combined all charts into a single dashboard in Tableau.  

&nbsp;  - Added filters (like gender, senior citizen, contract type) to make it interactive.

###### Key Insights

\- **Month‑to‑Month contracts** → highest churn risk.  

\- **Electronic check payments** → linked to higher churn.  

\- **Fiber optic customers** → churn more than DSL.  

\- **High monthly charges (60–90 range)** → churn spikes.  

\- **Tenure** → customers who survive the first year are more likely to stay long‑term.
